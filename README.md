# Skeep
A work in progress skype revival project.

The current progress is 
~0% - Only have just started.
I will update this counter manually as the project goes on.

The specific skype version that will be used for the project is 3.1.0.1005 (version number pulled from WindowsApp Skype_App folder.)


## What do we have currently:

Well. Nothing really.
The application is still currently unsolved. And we are no closer to figuring out the connection protocols.
We are aware that the app is UWP based meaning no porting of the app at this time.
The app is clearly based on HTML + CSS + JS.

### I want to help with the project, Where do I go?
